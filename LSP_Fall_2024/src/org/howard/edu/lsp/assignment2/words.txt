Design and code a program that reads a text file, 
and counts the number of times each word that it contains appears 100.
This file is used to test the word counter program. 
The design of the program should handle all cases like design, Design, or DESIGn, 
and ignore numbers like 123 or punctuation! This should also ignore words such as 'and', 'the', and 'it'.
